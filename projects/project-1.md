During the Spring 2020 semester, I had the great opportunity of working alongside professional mentors from the company [DataHouse](https://www.datahouse.com) and six other Computer Engineering students to develop a software-based solution for the Animal Quarantine facility, located at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport here on the island of Oahu.
  
By participating in the Community Innovation Mentorship Program (CIMP), I have learned the importance of all of the aspects of deploying a software-based solution from planner, financial, and developer perspectives. We also had the opportunity to learn about the Animal Quarantine Facility's processes in regards to general routines in order to develop a solution that was designed to ease day-to-day routines.

In terms of technical details, we developed the queueing and check-in system utilizing Angular CLI for the front-end and mySQL for the back-end. As one of the front-end developers of this project, I was able to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and the Angular framework. Gratefully, I was also able to improve my soft and technical skills by not only developing the solution, but also gaining relationships with both the client and our mentors.
