## The Start

Here I am, starting from scratch once again. Similar to baking, another hobby of mine, currently learning Javascript allows me to recall similar syntax structures from previously learned programming languages as I would recall ingredients and steps from previously baked recipes to succcessfully bake something delicious. So far, I am quite enjoying programming in Javascript as I am able to apply my already learned skills in another programming language. The thought of one day also incorporating Javascript with HTML/CSS also exites me as I thoroughly enjoy UX/UI design. 

## Current Experience

Compared to the other programming languages that I know such as C, C++, and Python, I can say that Javascript has been smooth sailing for the most part, in terms of comprehension and learning curve. That being said, I believe that it may be due to my experience in programming beforehand. In respect to the completion of all ES6 modules, I would like to say that my understanding of recursive methods have definitely increased as I have honestly struggled with the concept in previous experiences. Although I am unsure as to exactly why my experience has been extremely positive in this Javascript learning experience, I am not complaining one bit. So far, this learning experience has been a fun and almost stress relieving process, with some stress only being felt during weekly WODs. All-in-all, I definitely think Javascript is a good programming experience from a software engineering perspective as it seems to be a nice language to have under your belt.

## Athleticism in Programming

In terms of athletic software engineering, although it does induce some stress within myself to have weekly and timed programming challenges, the athletic side of me is quite fueled. Being unsuccessful in the first official WOD, I feel slightly nervous for the future challenges but mostly determined to be successful as I came close to completing it with success. Thankful for the practice WODs, I was able to come close in successfully completing the first WOD but fell short as I began to second-guess my methods after every line of code. Hopefully in the coming weeks, I will be able to say I have completed each WOD with flying colors while fueling both my athletic and developer passions.
