## The Beginning
Growing up, I had always envisioned myself becoming a chef, baker, or pediatrician. Operating as a member of the technology-loving world did not cross my mind until the very last
year of my high school career. As I came to the realization that I could always bake and cook as a hobby, my mind narrowed down to living a life as a pediatrician as I had a great 
interest in helping others and the science of medicine. However, as time continued, I also gained a great appreciation for technology and the process of development and innovation. Eventually, my interest branched out to the world of Bioengineering where I could possibly live the best of both worlds learning about the science of medicine while working on new waves of innovation. As I applied to the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I then grew an interest in the College of Engineering where I then decided that the Computer Engineering path was the path I would like to pursue as it allows me to learn about the many aspects of technology while being able to apply it to various fields.

## Realizations
Though the path to completing my degree in Computer Engineering was far from smooth sailing as I struggled in my courses, I am now proud to say I have grown as an individual in many ways both technically and internally. From having a great amount of self-doubt and being unable to complete a few lines of code, I can now say that I have contributed to various projects and am now working part-time for a wonderful IT Consulting company while I continue to pursue my degree. As a Computer Engineering student, I have learned the programming languages that are object-oriented such as C and C++. As a member of the Microrobotics VIP team, I have been able to learn MATLAB and Python in a different light as I am able to learn about neural networks while still engaging in my love for science. During my internship and mentorship opportunities with the company DataHouse, I have realized that I truly enjoy and have a great interest in UI/UX design and development. 

Tied to my passion for artistic creations, science, and technology, I found learning and developing solutions in HTML and CSS very enjoyable. Programming UX/UI aspects would feel like a break from reality as I enjoyed seeing improvements and additions to a webpage or application. 

## Future Hopes
In the future, I hope to continue learning many programming languages such as Java, Javascript, PHP, and C#. Working as a Software Engineer, I also hope to be a part of many projects that cultivate creative and efficient innovations that have the power of technology and development at its center. With my passion of aiding people in times of need, I hope to continue being a part of technological advancements that are driven by helping the many communities of the world.
