## Empty Beginnings

After grabbing my cup of iced coffee, taking a sip, and entering the land of programming for the day, who knows what lies ahead. Will it be a smooth errorless day of coding? Or will it be a day full of trials and long lists of things that went wrong? It all truly starts from a blank canvas waiting to be filled with color and life. In terms of coding, an empty file awaits to be filled with words in my favorite color scheme that hopefully brings successful executions and less road-blocking errors to debug. That being said, I would say that I have never been able to live a day full of programming where a single error hasn't been found.

## The Long Road Ahead

Though errors can be headache inducing, tiresome, and straight-up frustrating, I would say that it is what makes up part of the fun of being a developer. If it were all too easy and perfect to my liking, it would simply get boring as there is no form of challenge. Each day would go by seamlessly, nothing to make me stop and think about other possiblities. By utilizing IntelliJ IDEA along with ESLint as a day-to-day combination, hours of programming continue to feel enjoyable no matter the circumstance (as of late).

## Your Virtual Coding Best Friend

With my current day-to-day combination of utilizing IntelliJ IDEA and ESLint, it feels as if I am in a room with a lifelong mentor and best friend even though I may be sitting in a room completely alone. There I am, coding away on my computer with thoughts and ideas of various ways to implement certain concepts before the first execution and boom, errors galore. Now how must I go about resolving these issues? Well, thankfully, I am able to rely on my virtual mentor and best friend to guide me toward the path of success through little hints and notes marked throughout my code. By visually accentuating issues within the code, I am able to both learn and reinstate my knowledge of various programming concepts. From minor syntax errors to completely misunderstood concepts, I can always count on my virtual mentor and best friend to put me back on the right track. Gratefully, I am not only reminded of mistakes I have made but also of the good I may have done. That little green check mark in the top right corner always feels like a light tap on the back, a nice appreciated token of encouragement in my eyes. All-in-all, general coding standards may seem like a hassle to work around, but it continues to hold developers to a common level of programming that betters not only themselves, but others as well. From my perspective, it feels good to know that there's another pair of eyes watching over me and my code in the form of a virtual mentor and best friend that reminds me of both the bad and the good.
